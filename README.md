## Abstract

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning models, eliminating the need to 
collect local datasets at a central location. This course teaches the application of linear algebra and calculus to 
analyze and design FL systems, addressing real-world applications such as weather prediction and healthcare. 
You will learn to formulate FL applications as optimization problems and solve them with distributed algorithms. 
Students have the option to extend the course to 10 credits by completing a student project. This student project 
might be used to pilot ideas (e.g., for your doctoral research) and get peer feedback on them. 

To get a more concrete idea of what to expect, have a look at the  <a href="material/FL_LectureNotes.pdf"> draft for the lecture notes. </a>
